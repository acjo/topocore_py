## Overview

We build on what we did for the last coding assignment.
The releveant member functions for todays assignments are:

1. build_vietoris_rips_filtration: This is a class method that will build a filtration for threshold values from the pairwise distance matrix.
2.



```{python}

from topocore import SimplicialComplex

SimplicialComplex.build_vietoris_rips_filtration(max_dimension=1)


```
